Ruby on Rails Blog Project

This is a Ruby on Rails blog project that I used while learning. I added the following features:
- Login and logout
- Add/delete/edit posts
- Follow and unfollow users
- View the blog of another user

I also learned the following important topics:
- Creating routes
- Creating migration files and rake tasks
- Using ORM for Active Record Associations
- Using Rspec for TDD
- Understanding the MVC pattern
- Understanding different gems like devise and pundit for authentication and authorization
