# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

This is a Ruby on Rails project I used while learning, Here I have added some features like
1. The user has the ability to login and logout
2. The user has the ability to add/delete/edit post
3. One user can follow another user and show a following and followers list
4. Users can see the blog of another user whom they followed
